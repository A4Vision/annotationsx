Broad TODOs/Issues:

√ Restructure for TLT
-- Some backend fields don't accept unicode. This may mess up foreign language courses.
    -- May have to restructure DB
    -- I think this is just the primary ID field (the name I believe).
        Everything else I've tried has been chill with Unicode.
-- Need <br/> tags in text entry to format text to be annotated (especially brutal for poems)
    -- Might be nice if instructors could edit the content in the Canvas RTE
    -- Could oEmbed help us here?
√ Get rid of hard-coded stuff in hx_lti_initializer.views
√ Use auth middleware to allow us to stray from the launch page
-- Examine external database system. Do we want a local one for everything, or should we keep
	it as is with a catch on top of hat we have.
√ Make sure annotations show up at right place on correct assignment
-- Give instructor 'delete' permission on bad comments?
√ Improve Instructor index
√ Create Student index
-- 'Dashboard' feature
	-- List of students who have annotated something
		-- for grading purposes?
	-- List of a specific student's annotations
√ Duplicate student names break the tool, it seems (Test Student). Make that not happen.
-- Get rid of "resource_link_id=None" in configuration url...how does that get in there??
-- Figure out what highlight options are and why they are a required field
