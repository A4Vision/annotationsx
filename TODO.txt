Broad TODOs/Issues:

-- Restructure for TLT
-- Some backend fields don't accept unicode. This may mess up foreign language courses.
    -- May have to restructure DB
    -- I think this is just the primary ID field (the name I believe).
        Everything else I've tried has been chill with Unicode.
-- Need <br/> tags in text entry to format text to be annotated (especially brutal for poems)
    -- Might be nice if instructors could edit the content in the Canvas RTE
    -- Could oEmbed help us here?
