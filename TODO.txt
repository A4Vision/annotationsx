============================
BUGS
-- Can't use source material that someone else is already using
    (Warning view shows when they try)

-- Searching by user in the sidebar does not seem to be working (Annotation Text and Tag do though)
    My hunch is that this is due to
				self.queryDatabase({
					"username": text,
				});
    from DashboardController.js


-- On Fresh install, instructor has to refresh to get admin/edit privileges - for now there's a notice to refresh the page.

-- 'include instructor tab' checkbox doesn't seem to have any effect
    (hidden for now)

-- choosing a pagination limit doesn't seem to have any effect
    (This is likely a legacy of the old annotation display at the bottom - hidden for now)

-- tags don't seem to have any color effects anymore (this must've been broken by one of luis' annotation funtionality commits).
    (Warning text added to tell the user this is an issue)

============================
BROAD TODOS/ISSUES (To be done by fall launch)

√? (in progress/demo fix completed in another repo) The db max length for the id (name) field is 30. What about long names?

√? Django unique ID to be changed from user's name, to user's unique ID passed in by Canvas.
    -- Change user creation
    -- Change name display code
    -- (demo fix already completed in another repo)

-- Test Dashboard et. all to make sure thousands of annotations work.

-- Unit Tests :(
    -- Uncomment & try to fix old lduarte tests that we commented out earlier

============================
NOT A PRIORITY/TODO LONG-TERM:

-- Examine 'External CSS Default' functionality (in Course Settings)

-- Replies can only go 1 level deep. Do we want to be able to reply to replies?

-- <br> tags are added at the end of every annotation, which can make them display strangely in the dashboard

-- Implement editing functionality for replies? Right now it's just deletion.
    (this was a bug earlier, but now is a TODO because Luis wisely changed the frontend - now it doesn't show 'edit/delete,' only 'delete')

-- Decide whether we want to support deletion of source material. This is dangerous because it's a shared resource.
    Perhaps this is something that only admins with access to the django backend should do. (which is how it works right now)

-- Decide whether we want to hide the annotation DB tab from assignment creation
    the typical instructor would likely not need it.

-- Setting someone as a course admin only means that that person's annotations will show up
    in the instructor tab. Actual admin rights are still based on roles. We may want to circle back 
    to this based on desired functionality from our first users.

-- Link to dashboard from the detail? So you don't have to go back to the index.
    -- Find out what users want

-- Sometimes going back/forward works smoothly,
    sometimes the document expires. 'Refresh' always takes you back to the index.
    Not a huge deal but something to keep in mind. iFrames are like that I guess.

-- Assignment/annotation deletion from the catch database? Do we even want this?

-- Hover to annotate? This was working at one point, I believe.

-- Maybe make a better looking UI in the index view

============================
COMPLETED

√ Restructure for TLT
√ Get rid of hard-coded stuff in hx_lti_initializer.views
√ Allow ourselves to stray from the launch page
√ Improve Instructor index
√ Create Student index
√ Make sure annotations show up at right place on correct assignment
√ Navigation improvements: add in a 'return to index' type of button
√ Clicking on assignment objects shouldn't show the collection ID. Make those just plain text.
√ Add requests library to requirements.txt
√ Allow movement from instructor index to annotation objects
√ Figure out what highlight options are/how we can use them (note: use them like this: "instructor:red")
√ Make advised changes from Pull Request #3 (Harry and Christian's first one):
    https://github.com/Harvard-ATG/annotationsx/pull/3#discussion_r35117072
        √ ensure people with multiple roles will work
        √ correct url routing
√ 'Dashboard' feature
	√ Mock-up
	√ List of students who have annotated something
	√ List of a specific student's annotations
	√ Remove hard-coded data
√ (fixed) All annotations for a student are shown in the dashboard, as opposed to just the ones for that course.
√ Give instructor 'delete' permission on bad comments?
√ Get rid of "resource_link_id=None" in configuration url...how does that get in there?? )
    (Note: this was there from the django multi lti middleware class)
√ Remove the need for <br/> tags in text entry to format text to be annotated (especially brutal for poems)
√ Prettier URL routing code
√ Make sure only the annotations for the correct course are coming in, not all the annotations the user has ever made.
√ (fixed) Duplicate student names break the tool, it seems (Test Student). Make that not happen.
    Right now, trailing whitespace is added recursively to make a unique name that still displays well.
    Ideally the DB would be modified to allow something other than the student's name to be the primary key
√ Create a default for an empty dashboard or a student with no annotations
√ Refactor for TLT
	√ all secure/variable settings should be in secure.py
√ (fixed) Unicode in annotation object title bricks entire DB for all courses
√ (fixed) Unicode assignment and target object names not showing up in dashboard
√ Make sure only the students for the right course are shown in the dashboard.
√ (fixed) Source material not showing up in 'edit assignment' view
    explicit field meta declaration in assignment forms was messing up the relation
√ (fixed) Can't add multiple texts to an assignment
√ (fixed) Students can only be a member on one course, or else everything breaks.
√ (fixed) Shorter Target Object names make skinny tables, which shrink after being opened. Little UI blip.
√ (fixed) Edit button next to assignment opens objects list below it, before linking into the edit. Little UI blip.
√ Assignment Deletion
√ Infer default course title from LTI Launch
√ Sidebar functionality (basic functionality is there)
√ Hide irrelevant/unimplemented frontend fields
    √ target creator or target course options in target object creation should be able to be inferred
    √ External CSS
    √ Tags are required right now, they should be hidden and turned on automatically
√ Don't need 'to add a new course' etc. in the little left-float bubble.
√ Set defaults for frontend fields that can usually be inferred
    √ In 'Create Source Material'
        √ Course should default to current course
        √ Content creator should default to current user
    √ In 'Create Assignment'
        √ Annotation DB Key, URL, and Secret should have defaults pre-populated.
√ (Fixed by Luis) The database token appears to be included in the JavaScript, which can be used to get the entire database
√ Update Documentation
√ Create high-level documentation
√ (fixed) Can't reply to annotations
√ (single-instructor invariant eliminated)
    Can now have multiple instructors/TFs show up in the 'instructor' tab.
√ (fixed) Sometimes annotation editing gets x-frame denied (just editing, which is weird)
√ iFrame sizing
√ (fixed) Editing from sidebar is broken in the latest commit (was working before). Deletion works though.
√ Clean up the code for validating the target_object entry (create_new_assignment.html, jscript at the top)
√ Put in an error/warning telling users what's going wrong when they try to add source material someone else is using.
    √ Also when they don't select source material

============================
DIFFERENCES FROM LUIS
-- Fetches a single course (named active_course) as opposed to fetching all courses for admin
-- Routes student to modified admin_hub by default as opposed to directly to an assignment,
    though we support that functionality as well
-- Instructor can edit and delete student annotations
-- Home button on assignment pages
-- tagging enabled by default, and hidden from the frontend (the whole thing doesn't work unless tagging is on, so we have to force it to be on)
-- Default tab to desplay for annotations is hidden, because it doesn't seem to be working.
-- 'Include instructor tab' checkbox is hidden, because it doesn't seem to have any effect.
-- Pagination tab is hidden, because it doesn't seem to have any effect
