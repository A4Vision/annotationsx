============================
BUGS
-- Deletion of replies doesn't seem to work 
-- Last updated doesn't work
-- Can't use the same text across multiple assignments
-- Other instructors' texts (well, all texts really) show up in 'add source material'

============================

BROAD TODOS/ISSUES (To be done by fall launch)

-- Clean up the code for validating the target_object entry (create_new_assignment.html, jscript at the top)
    My current solution is a total hack

-- Link to dashboard from the detail? So you don't have to go back to the index.

-- Test Dashboard et. all to make sure thousands of annotations work.

-- The database token appears to be included in the JavaScript, which can be used to get the entire database
    -- (we tried curl requests with this token from the command line and were able to dump the whole annotations table/db)
    -- maybe more strictly permission-bound tokens could help us here

-- Update Documentation (may want to wait until we're done with everything else)

-- Unit Tests :(


============================
NOT A PRIORITY/TODO LONG-TERM:

-- Currently, we assume that there is only one instructor when it comes to loading in annotations for the instructor tab.
    Eventually we may want to add support for TFs as well.

-- Sometimes going back/forward works smoothly,
    sometimes the document expires. 'Refresh' always takes you back to the index.
    Not a huge deal but something to keep in mind. iFrames are like that I guess.

-- Assignment/annotation deletion from the catch database? Do we even want this?

-- Hover to annotate? This was working at one point, I believe.

-- The db max length for the id (name) field is 30. What about long names?
    (Note: this is a django requirement


============================
COMPLETED

√ Restructure for TLT
√ Get rid of hard-coded stuff in hx_lti_initializer.views
√ Allow ourselves to stray from the launch page
√ Improve Instructor index
√ Create Student index
√ Make sure annotations show up at right place on correct assignment
√ Navigation improvements: add in a 'return to index' type of button
√ Clicking on assignment objects shouldn't show the collection ID. Make those just plain text.
√ Add requests library to requirements.txt
√ Allow movement from instructor index to annotation objects
√ Figure out what highlight options are/how we can use them (note: use them like this: "instructor:red")
√ Make advised changes from Pull Request #3 (Harry and Christian's first one):
    https://github.com/Harvard-ATG/annotationsx/pull/3#discussion_r35117072
        √ ensure people with multiple roles will work
        √ correct url routing
√ 'Dashboard' feature
	√ Mock-up
	√ List of students who have annotated something
	√ List of a specific student's annotations
	√ Remove hard-coded data
√ (fixed) All annotations for a student are shown in the dashboard, as opposed to just the ones for that course.
√ Give instructor 'delete' permission on bad comments?
√ Get rid of "resource_link_id=None" in configuration url...how does that get in there?? )
    (Note: this was there from the django multi lti middleware class)
√ Remove the need for <br/> tags in text entry to format text to be annotated (especially brutal for poems)
√ Prettier URL routing code
√ Make sure only the annotations for the correct course are coming in, not all the annotations the user has ever made.
√ (fixed) Duplicate student names break the tool, it seems (Test Student). Make that not happen.
    Right now, trailing whitespace is added recursively to make a unique name that still displays well.
    Ideally the DB would be modified to allow something other than the student's name to be the primary key
√ Create a default for an empty dashboard or a student with no annotations
√ Refactor for TLT
	√ all secure/variable settings should be in secure.py
√ (fixed) Unicode in annotation object title bricks entire DB for all courses
√ (fixed) Unicode assignment and target object names not showing up in dashboard
√ Make sure only the students for the right course are shown in the dashboard.
√ (fixed) Source material not showing up in 'edit assignment' view
    explicit field meta declaration in assignment forms was messing up the relation
√ (fixed) Can't add multiple texts to an assignment
√ (fixed) Students can only be a member on one course, or else everything breaks.
√ (fixed) Shorter Target Object names make skinny tables, which shrink after being opened. Little UI blip.
√ (fixed) Edit button next to assignment opens objects list below it, before linking into the edit. Little UI blip.
√ Assignment Deletion

============================
DIFFERENCES FROM LUIS
-- Fetches a single course (named active_course) as opposed to fetching all courses for admin
-- Routes student to modified admin_hub as opposed to directly to an assignment
-- Instructor can edit and delete student annotations
-- Home button on assignment pages
