CHARLES FRIED: Well, you&#39;ve probably already worked this all out,

1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,020
but let me help you with a couple of stories.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,060
One of them is a story of Jonah and the whale.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,800
Remember what happens with Jonah?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,680
Jonah is on the ship, and they have a tremendous storm.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,090
And they figure out one of the things we have to do is throw Jonah overboard.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,680
And that&#39;ll calm the waters, because the good Lord is angry with Jonah.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,410
You know the rest of the story.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,280
But that story connects up to the ancient law of the sea, which

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,930
even today is respected.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
The ancient law of the sea addresses this problem.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,750
You&#39;ve got a storm at sea.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,470
You have a cargo, which is in peril, and the master of the ship

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,990
reasonably decides that in order to survive-- in order for the sailors,

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,890
and for the passengers, and for any of the cargo to survive,

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,530
they&#39;ve got to throw a significant part of the cargo overboard.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,350
They&#39;ve got to lighten the ship.

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,870
And that&#39;s what they do.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:19,790
The ship survives, they put into port, and they unload the remaining cargo.

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,710
Well, what about those people whose cargo

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,110
was thrown overboard to save the ship?

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,490
Are they just out of luck?

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,530
Maybe some of them had very heavy cargo, and so that&#39;s

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,980
why the master quite reasonably decided to throw it overboard.

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,250
And the others had lighter but much more valuable

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,320
cargo-- let&#39;s say silk or spices-- and that&#39;s what survived.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,810
Could we just say that the folks whose stuff was thrown overboard

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,860
are out of luck, and the others are in luck?

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,970
That&#39;s not what the ancient law of the seas says,

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,990
and that&#39;s not the law of the sea now.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,850
Today, you have a rule which goes by the name of general average.

31
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,200
And the general average is what you do in a situation like this.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,260
You figure out what the total value of the cargo of the ship was.

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,940
Let&#39;s say the total value was worth $1,000.

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,210
What you did is you had to throw $300 worth of cargo overboard--

35
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,050
$300 worth of stone or blocks of marble--

36
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,080
to save the remaining cargo of silk and spices.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,370
The remaining cargo doesn&#39;t just thank its lucky stars and count its blessings

38
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,080
all the way to the bank.

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,630
Not at all.

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,890
We saw 3/10 of the worth of the total cargo was lost.

41
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,440
It was sacrificed in order to save the remaining cargo.

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,860
The marble was sacrificed in order to save the silk and spices.

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,210
Under the law of the sea, the owners of all the cargo

44
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,150
get together under what&#39;s called general average and each of them

45
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,750
ends up with 7/10 of the value of the total cargo.

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,790
The people whose cargo was thrown overboard

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,210
get 7/10 of the value of theirs.

48
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:33,070
And the people whose cargo survived get only 7/10 of theirs.

49
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,670
It&#39;s a kind of insurance policy, a sharing of risk.

50
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,440
They all shared the risk, and they all ended up losing proportionately.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,540
But nobody lost everything.

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,300
Nobody got away without losing something-- well, except for Jonah.
